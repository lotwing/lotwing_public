%p
  %strong HOW IS DATA STORED?
%p
  Data is stored in servers in the United States of America. LotWing uses HTTPS communication protocol via Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.
%p
  Any communication you have with us will be stored in the medium and technology that it is sent. For example, if you send an email to us, then that email will be stored in our email system.
%p
  Account Data
%p
  Passwords you enter are never stored directly. Instead, they are converted to a unique set of characters (called a "hash") that can be used in the future to verify the same password is entered, but cannot be used to determine the original password. The hash is additionally secured through encryption and other security processes such as using per entry salts and iteration counts.
%p
  Usernames and Email Addresses are stored encrypted and as encrypted hashes.
%p
  Account Usage Data
%p
  Login times and signup times are stored in plain text.
%p
  Log Data
%p
  Log data is stored as plain text logs.
%p
  Data Security
%p
  We strive to implement and maintain reasonable, industry-standard secure storage technologies and commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, we cannot ensure or warrant 100% security of any information you provide to us or guarantee that information on the Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized persons or hardware or software failure. Further, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the information we have collected from you.
%p
  Therefore, if you create an account and therefore provide information such as your username, password and email address, it is recommended you choose a username that is not linked to your identity, a password that is randomly generated and managed by a password management system, and an email address that is not linked to your identity and is secured with a robust password and two-factor authentication.
%p
  We will never send you an email asking for your password, or any personal information, and if you see any such thing then you should contact us at
  =mail_to "dietmar@lotwing.com", "dietmar@lotwing.com.", style:'color:#FF9933'
